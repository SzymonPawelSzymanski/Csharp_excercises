# Csharp_exc1

This is a simple program I created while learning C#.

Every class here named **"ZadX"** is a different excercise/program I wrote to solve a simple problem I found on the list of https://www.w3resource.com/csharp-exercises/

You don't need anything except a C# compilator to run it.


## Structure

**Program.cs** is a class that runs the program

**Zad1.cs** - Input string, print string <br />
**Zad2.cs** - Basic calculator for two integers <br />
**Zad3.cs** - Computes a math operation from a string <br />
**Zad4.cs** - Swaps two integers without using the third one <br />
**Zad5.cs** - Input three numbers, get their multiplication <br />
